uvicorn[standard]>=0.27.0  # Python 3.13 compatible
pydantic>=2.10.0  # Python 3.13 compatible (v2.10+ works well with Python 3.13)

PyJWT>=2.8.0

# Database
sqlalchemy>=2.0.30  # Python 3.13 compatible

# Google ADK / Multi-Agent
# google-ads>=28.0.0  # Updated version (23.0.0 doesn't exist, latest is 28.x)
# If using actual Google ADK for Python (multi-agent workflow)
# install the package specific to the agent SDK you choose
# For now, you can pip install 'google-ads' to mock the SDK

# Vector embeddings / optional
# NOTE: ChromaDB pulls in a very large dependency graph (opentelemetry, k8s, etc.) and can cause
# pip to fail on Render with `resolution-too-deep`. Prefer Postgres + pgvector for production.
# If you truly need Chroma, add it back later with pinned versions via a lockfile.
# chromadb==1.5.0
pgvector>=0.3.0

# Utilities
requests>=2.32.2
python-multipart>=0.0.9

# LLM (Gemini)
# NOTE: `google-adk` is the main cause of the `resolution-too-deep` error. Keep it out of your
# web runtime unless you absolutely need it.
google-generativeai==0.8.6

# Optional: if you later need the ADK, add it in a separate worker/service or pin via a lockfile.
google-adk==1.25.0
